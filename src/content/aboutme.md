Hi there! I am **Mustafa Aydar**, a Full-Stack Web and Python developer from Turkey, but I live in The Netherlands now, more precisely in Amsterdam.

I am a curious, proactive and happy father of a daughter that wants to build a great career by doing one of the things that I love the most: Solving problems. While (and after) obtaining degrees In Systems Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and a masters in Cultural Anthropology, I worked for the Turkish Government for 10 years at different positions. During my succesfull career, I was always a part of a team and led teams. I was a part of effective projects and tasks such as "Preventing and Investigating of Crimes, Forensic Investigation, Student Counseling".

When I came to The Netherlands I wanted (and needed) a career change. Coincidentally, I stumbled upon HackYourFuture, and I didn’t stopped coding ever since. I could say I’m fascinated by web and software development! 

Besides graduating from HackYourFuture, building the projects that I showcase in this website, getting my Dutch IDs in order and (not less important) settling in this new and amazing country, I followed a Python Programming & Data Science Program at PyCoders. 

What I find most amazing about development is that solving problems,finding innovative solutions to these problems, non-stop learning and improvement.

I am looking forward to join an experienced team to contribute to building great product
